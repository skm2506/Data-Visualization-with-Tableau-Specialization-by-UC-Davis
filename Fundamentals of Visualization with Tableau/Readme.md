# About this Course:
###
In this first course of the specialization, you will discover just what data visualization is, and how we can use it to better see and understand data. Using Tableau, weâ€™ll examine the fundamental concepts of data visualization and explore the Tableau interface, identifying and applying the various tools Tableau has to offer. By the end of the course you will be able to prepare and import data into Tableau and explain the relationship between data analytics and data visualization. This course is designed for the learner who has never used Tableau before, or who may need a refresher or want to explore Tableau in more depth.  No prior technical or analytical background is required.  The course will guide you through the steps necessary to create your first visualization story from the beginning based on data context,  setting the stage for you to advance to the next course in the Specialization.
